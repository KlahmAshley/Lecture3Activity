 read me with descriptions of what was done, and a reflection of strenghts, weaknesses, and opportunities identified throughout the activity.

 During class I was able to work out the multi UV shader as well as the reflective shader! *SEE IMAGES ATTACHED IN THE REPOSITORY

I think doing this in class is helping me better debug code and figure out where I'm having errors. A weakness is I feel that I am still just copying 
the code down and not fully understanding what exactly I am doing. I think it would be benefical to really break down exactly what we are doing in 
simpler terms to ensure we understand how it is working. However I think it was a good opportunity to see where I still need clarity and improvement
in terms of my CG knowledge and understanding.
